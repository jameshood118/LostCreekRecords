Western Tennessee<BR>

Driving down Virginia, Washington DC is far behind
Into Tennessee, heading for a place to clear my mind
When Nashville&#039;s way behind me, my mind is feeling free
Cause soon I&#039;ll see the lovely river called the Tennessee
The land along the river has been calling me.

My cousin Jeff says let&#039;s go get the horses; we&#039;ll ride up in the hills.
So we saddle up and make our way along the back roads and through the fallow fields.
And Jeff is up on Johnnie, and I&#039;m on a horse named King
And right now I don&#039;t care about a cotton-pickin&#039; thing
I&#039;m riding high and wide and feeling free
In Western Tennessee.

These quarter horses know the land.  They take us into places seldom seen - 
through timeless hills and meadows, along the gullies and through the shallow streams.
I see the redbuds and the dogwoods moving in the breeze
I smell the woods and horses and the dogs are smelling me.
This air is like a tonic for a man who longs to breathe.
In Western Tennessee

The churches with their cemeteries take us from the present to the past
The markers seem to say to take our time, don&#039;t let it go so fast.
And if I could I&#039;d stay up on this horse and on this hill
I&#039;ve tried to like the city, but I guess I never will.
The land along the river calls me still.
<BR>
And soon I&#039;ll have to go cause I&#039;ve got promises to make and some to keep
But one day I&#039;ll return and never leave, cause this is home to me.
I can see from on this hill the day is nearly done 
The road is like another river running to the sun
This land along the river always calls to me
From Western Tennessee.
There ain&#039;t no place on earth I&#039;d rather be
Than Western Tennessee.
